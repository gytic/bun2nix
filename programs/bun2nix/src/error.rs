Make sure that the bun lockfile path you gave points to a valid path.

Try changing the file path to point to one, or create one with `bun install` on a version of bun above v1.2.

See https://bun.sh/docs/install/lockfile to find out more information about the textual lockfile.

Try `bun2nix -h` for help.
