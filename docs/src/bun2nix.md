`bun2nix` is a fast Rust-based tool for converting lock-files generated by the [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (v1.2+) package manager to [Nix](https://nixos.wiki/) expressions, which allows them to be consumed to build Bun packages reproducibly.

## Advantages

Here are some of the advantages of using `bun2nix` over the alternatives:

- Much faster than other similar `lang2nix` tools for the JavaScript ecosystem - a full install will only take around 50ms for a medium project with 2k packages
- Build AOT-compiled binaries easily with Bun that fit the Nix model much better than NPM scripts
- Quality error messages because of the static types in Rust

## Alternatives

Here are some alternatives to `bun2nix` in the JavaScript ecosystem which fulfill a similar purpose:

- [`node2nix`](https://github.com/svanderburg/node2nix)
- [`yarn2nix`](https://github.com/nix-community/yarn2nix)
- [`js2nix`](https://github.com/canva-public/js2nix)
